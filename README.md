Intro
-----

This repository provides the codes for the CVPR16 paper, â€œ[Deep Region and Multi-Label Learning for Facial Action Unit Detection](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Zhao_Deep_Region_and_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)".
This code aims for training a convolutional network that contains a *region layer* for specializing the learned kernels on different facial regions, and meanwhile utilizes a multi-label cross-entropy to jointly learn 12 AUs.
This implementation is based on [Caffe Toolbox](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe). 


Code structure
--------------

Based on the caffe toolbox, we organize the source files as follows:

`include/caffe/`: Header files that contains the declaration of our implemented layers

`prototxt/`: Network architecture we used to compuare and report in our paper

`src/caffe/layers/`: Source files of our implemented layers
